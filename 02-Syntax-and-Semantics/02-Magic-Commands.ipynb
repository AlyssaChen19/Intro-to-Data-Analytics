discussing some of the enhancements that IPython adds on top of the normal Python syntax.\n","These are known in IPython as *magic commands*, and are prefixed by the ``%`` character.\n","These magic commands are designed to succinctly solve various common problems in standard data analysis.\n","Magic commands come in two flavors: *line magics*, which are denoted by a single ``%`` prefix and operate on a single line of input, and *cell magics*, which are denoted by a double ``%%`` prefix and operate on multiple lines of input.\n","We'll demonstrate and discuss a few brief examples here, and come back to more focused discussion of several useful magic commands later in the chapter."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PgYjleIbProf"},"source":["## Running External Code: ``%run``\n","As you begin developing more extensive code, you will likely find yourself working in both IPython for interactive exploration, as well as a text editor to store code that you want to reuse.\n","Rather than running this code in a new window, it can be convenient to run it within your IPython session.\n","This can be done with the ``%run`` magic.\n","\n","For example, imagine you've created a ``myscript.py`` file with the following contents:\n","\n","```python\n","#-------------------------------------\n","# file: myscript.py\n","\n","def square(x):\n","    \"\"\"square a number\"\"\"\n","    return x ** 2\n","\n","for N in range(1, 4):\n","    print(N, \"squared is\", square(N))\n","```\n","\n","You can execute this from your IPython session as follows:\n","\n","```ipython\n","In [6]: %run myscript.py\n","1 squared is 1\n","2 squared is 4\n","3 squared is 9\n","```\n","\n","Note also that after you've run this script, any functions defined within it are available for use in your IPython session:\n","\n","```ipython\n","In [7]: square(5)\n","Out[7]: 25\n","```\n","\n","There are several options to fine-tune how your code is run; you can see the documentation in the normal way, by typing **``%run?``** in the IPython interpreter."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"659UMyMBProg"},"source":["## Timing Code Execution: ``%timeit``\n","Another example of a useful magic function is ``%timeit``, which will automatically determine the execution time of the single-line Python statement that follows it.\n","For example, we may want to check the performance of a list comprehension:\n","\n","```ipython\n","In [8]: %timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in range(1000)]\n","1000 loops, best of 3: 325 µs per loop\n","```\n","\n","The benefit of ``%timeit`` is that for short commands it will automatically perform multiple runs in order to attain more robust results.\n","For multi line statements, adding a second ``%`` sign will turn this into a cell magic that can handle multiple lines of input.\n","For example, here's the equivalent construction with a ``for``-loop:\n","\n","```ipython\n","In [9]: %%timeit\n","   ...: L = []\n","   ...: for n in range(1000):\n","   ...:     L.append(n ** 2)\n","   ...:\n","1000 loops, best of 3: 373 µs per loop\n","```\n","\n","We can immediately see that list comprehensions are about 10% faster than the equivalent ``for``-loop construction in this case."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in
